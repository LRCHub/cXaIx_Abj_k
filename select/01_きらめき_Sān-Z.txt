In the starry skies, the brilliance flows
Each moment shines, a grand symphony grows
Look up high
Between us, shadows etch the heart's reply
In a flash, reality leaves us lost
With its utmost
Time is the long lane of memories past
Where the end feels hidden, shadows cast
I never tried to guess
Your responding gazes give me strength
Illuminating me, banishing hesitation
Shining
Under the light, I create our melody
Let every thought blend in harmony
And every thought in this moment becomes song
Under the light, I play the galaxy's message
And embrace the hope brought by happiness
Starlight illuminates the horizon
A memory that belongs to us
Echoes remain, a bittersweet refrain
In the depths, we dance through joy and pain
Yet we've never let fear hold us down
The past no longer chains; it's strength we have found
A radiant glow, letting out spirits flow
Shining
Under the light, I create melodies of the future
Let the world sing of courage and adventure
Recording the most glorious song we've made
Under the light, I play the universe's magic
To purge this unease
After the storm disappears, wild freedom is our
Dawn
Hope
A memory that belongs to us
